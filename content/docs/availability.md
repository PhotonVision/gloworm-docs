A batch of ~50 Gloworm units were produced and sold out in December of 2020. At the moment, given the state of FRC in the era of COVID-19 and the global chip shortage, there are no active plans to produce more. That being said, once demand returns and the chip shortage subsides, it is my intent to manufacture another batch. If you are interested in buying a Gloworm once they are restocked, please fill out [this interest check](https://forms.gle/6wkA2EEYwm6ZA7Px7).

If you are a manufacturer that is interested in producing and selling Gloworm units, you are welcome to. The hardware source is distributed under a very permissive license.
